			Apply to get qualified teacher status in England
		</h1>

		<p>
			Teacher training in England leads to qualified teacher status (QTS). QTS is a legal requirement to teach in
			many English schools.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you trained to teach outside the UK, you can use the service to apply for qualified teacher status (QTS).
		</p>

		<p>To make an application, you will need to upload a PDF or jpeg of your:</p>
		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			<li>personal identification document, including proof of any name change</li>
			<li>degree qualification certificate</li>
			<li>teacher training qualification certificate</li>
			<li>teacher training qualification transcript</li>
			<li>letter of professional standing, if you do not have a registration number</li>
		</ul>

		<p>You cannot use this service if you have ever been banned from teaching or working with children, or if you
			have ever started but not completed teacher training in England.</p>
