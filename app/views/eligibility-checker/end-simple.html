		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
			Certified translations

			Finding a certified translator
		</h2>

		<p class="govuk-body">
			You can find a professional translator through the <a href="https://www.iti.org.uk/component/itisearch/?view=translators" target="_blank">Institute of Translating and Interpreting (ITI) (opens in new tab)</a>. 
			All listed translators have been certified by the ITI and are qualified to complete translations.
		</p>

		<p>
			Alternatively, some universities may be able to provide certified translation.
			 You could search for universities with a language department and contact them for advice.
