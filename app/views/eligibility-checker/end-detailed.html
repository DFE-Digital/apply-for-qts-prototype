			You can find a professional translator through the <a href="https://www.iti.org.uk/component/itisearch/?view=translators" target="_blank">Institute of Translating and Interpreting (ITI) (opens in new tab)</a>. 
			All listed translators have been certified by the ITI and are qualified to complete translations.

		<p>
			Alternatively, some universities may be able to provide certified translation.
			 You could search for universities with a language department and contact them for advice.
