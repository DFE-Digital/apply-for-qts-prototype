		<p class="govuk-body">
			There are 4 ways to prove your English language ability.
		</p>

		<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">1. Born in or have citizenship of an exempt country</h3>

		<p>
			If you were born in or hold citizenship of any of these countries, you’re exempt from English language requirements:

		<p>
			Qualified teachers from Great Britain, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Guernsey are also exempt.
			You’ll need to provide your passport or official identification documents for that country as proof.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you’re not exempt by birth or citizenship, you must be able to provide evidence 
			of your English language ability in one of the following ways:
		</p>


		<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">2. If you studied in an exempt country</h3>

		<p>
			Upload the transcript from your teaching qualification or university degree (which you can request from the institution where you studied). 
			Check the exempt countries listed in ‘Born in or have citizenship of an exempt country’.
		</p>


		<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">3. If you studied in a country that’s NOT exempt</h3>

		<p>
			If your teaching qualification or university degree was taught exclusively in the English language you can upload an official document, sometimes called a Medium of Instruction (MOI).
		</p>

		<p>
			You can request this from the institution where you studied. It must be signed and stamped by them on official headed paper and it must state that the medium of instruction was English. 
			It must also include your name, degree title and award date.
		</p>

		<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">4. Provide an approved English language certificate</h3>

		<p>
			If you cannot provide one of the documents described in 1,2 or 3, you'll need a <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/table-1-cefr-3.3-common-reference-levels-global-scale" target="_blank">B2 level</a> Secure English Language Test (SELT) from an approved provider. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Find an <a href="https://test.apply-for-qts-in-england.education.gov.uk/english_language_guidance" target="_blank">approved provider and SELT</a> if you need to get an English language certificate.

				If you’re a national of more than 1 country and both are exempt from English language requirements, you can choose which of them you use to apply for QTS. Remember, you must be able to show a passport (or the recognised identity document for that country).
				<br><br>
				If you hold a second nationality that is not exempt (and you apply for QTS using that nationality) you’ll need to prove your English language proficiency using one of the other methods.

		  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
			Recognition as a teacher
		</h2>
		<p>
			As your education department or authority has an online register of teachers, 
			you’ll also need to provide any registration numbers we need to check your record.
		</p>

		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
			Work experience history
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			You need to show you’ve been employed as a teacher in a school for at least 9 months or more.
			The teaching roles you include as proof can be from working in any country but must have occurred after becoming qualified to teach.
		</p>

		<p>
			You’ll need to provide the name and email address of a contact who can confirm that during your professional work experience you:
		</p>

		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			<li>worked in a school that delivers mandatory education</li>
			<li>worked unsupervised with children aged between 5 and 16 years</li>
			<li>were solely responsible for planning, preparing and delivering lessons to at least 4 students at a time</li>
