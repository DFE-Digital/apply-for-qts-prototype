			Providing certified translations to apply for QTS

		<p class="govuk-body">	
			If your documents are not written in English, 
			you’ll need to provide certified translations of them (at your own cost).
		</p>



		<p class="govuk-body">
			A certified translator must state (on the translated document or a separate certification page)
			 that it’s a true, accurate and correct copy of the original.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
			Each translated document must include the date of the translation as well as the certified translator’s:

		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			<li>signature</li>
			<li>name and contact details</li>
			<li>official certification seal/stamp or ID number</li>
		</ul>



		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
			Finding a certified translator
		</h2>

		<p class="govuk-body">
			You can find a professional translator through the <a href="https://www.iti.org.uk/component/itisearch/?view=translators" target="_blank">Institute of Translating and Interpreting (ITI) (opens in new tab)</a>. 
			All listed translators have been certified by the ITI and are qualified to complete translations.
		</p>

		<p>
			Alternatively, some universities may be able to provide certified translation.
			 You could search for universities with a language department and contact them for advice.
