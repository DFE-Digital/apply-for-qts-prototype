			Apply for qualified teacher status (QTS) in England

		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
			What QTS is 
		</h2>

		<p class="govuk-body">
			Qualified teacher status is a legal requirement to teach in many schools in England. It is a status that most schools prefer their teachers to have. 
			<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts" target="_blank">Find out more about QTS</a>.
		</p>

		<p class="govuk-body">
			Having QTS does not guarantee  you a job or give you the right to  work in England.
			 You'll still need to apply for a teaching job seperately  and have the correct visa or status.

			How this service works

		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
			<li>You need to check if you're eligible to apply for QTS.</li>
			<li>If you're eligible, you'll be able to make an application.</li>
			<li>Once you submit your application, we will assess the qualifications and teaching experience 
				you gained outside England to decide if we can award you with QTS. 
				The decision we make will only be based on whether you meet our assessment criteria.</li>
		</ul>


		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
