			What this service does
		</h2>

		<p class="govuk-body">
			We will assess the qualifications and teaching experience you gained outside England to decide if 
			we can award you with qualified teacher staus (QTS). The decision we make will only be based on 
			whether you meet our assessment criteria.
		</p>

		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
			What QTS is 
		</h2>

		<p class="govuk-body">
			Qualified teacher status is a legal requirement to teach in many schools in England. It is a status that most schools prefer their teachers to have. 
			Find out more about QTS.
		</p>

		<p class="govuk-body">
			Having QTS does not guarantee  you a job or give you the right to  work in England. You'll still need to apply for a teaching job seperately  and have the correct  visa or status. 
		</p>


		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
