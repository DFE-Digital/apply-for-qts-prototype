        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’ll ask for</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">You’ll need to provide proof of your:</p>

            <li>Identity</li>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">About certified translations</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">If your documents are not written in English, you’ll need to provide certified translations (at your own cost) for qualifications, transcripts, and proof that you're recognised as a teacher.

        <p class="govuk-body">A certified translator must state (on the translated document or a separate certification page) that it’s a true, accurate and correct copy of the original.

        <p class="govuk-body">Each one must include the date of the translation as well as the certified translator’s:

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>signature</li>
            <li>name and contact details</li>
            <li>official certification seal/stamp or ID number</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">We cannot recommend translation providers. You may want to search for translators who are members of the <a href="http://www.iti.org.uk/component/itisearch/?view=translators" class="govuk-link"
