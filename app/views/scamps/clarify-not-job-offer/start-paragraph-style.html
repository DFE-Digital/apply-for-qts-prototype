			Check your eligibility to apply for qualified teacher status (QTS) in England

		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
			What QTS is
		</h2>

		<p class="govuk-body">Qualified teacher status (QTS) is a legal requirement to teach in many English schools, and most schools prefer their teachers to have it.</p>

		<p class="govuk-body">If you apply for QTS we’ll assess the teacher training and experience you gained outside of England to decide whether you’re qualified to teach in English schools.</p>

		<p class="govuk-body">Having QTS does not guarantee you a job or give you the right to work in England. You’ll still need to have the correct visa or status and apply for jobs directly through UK schools. The Department for Education (DfE) does not employ or recruit teachers.</p>

		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
			Who this service is for
		</h2>

		<p class="govuk-body">This service is for qualified teachers who trained outside of England who want to apply
			for qualified teacher status (QTS) to teach in English schools.</p>

		<p class="govuk-body">If you trained in England or Wales, or have not yet qualified, learn more about <a
				href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/train-to-be-a-teacher">other routes to QTS</a>.</p>

		<p class="govuk-body">Use this service to:</p>

		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			<li>check whether you’re eligible to apply for QTS</li>
			<li>understand the types of evidence you’ll need to provide.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="govuk-body">We’ll ask some questions to check your eligibility to apply for QTS in England. This
			should take about 5 minutes.</p>

		<p class="govuk-body">There’s no charge to apply for QTS. You do not need to be in the UK to use this
			service.</p>

		<p class="govuk-body">If you’ve already started your application using this service, you can <a
