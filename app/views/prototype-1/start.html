        Apply to get qualified teacher status in England
      </h1>

      <p>
        Teacher training in England leads to qualified teacher status (QTS). QTS is a legal requirement to teach in many English schools.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you trained to teach outside the UK, you can use the service to apply for qualified teacher status (QTS). You’ll be asked to prove you trained and qualified at a similar level to teachers trained in England.
